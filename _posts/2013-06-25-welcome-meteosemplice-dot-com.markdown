<span style="color: red">UPDATE: I had to power off meteosemplice.com, because i was doing too many calls at the api web site. Any suggestion for a cheap and affordable api service about meteo?</span>

Another django site is online: [meteosemplice.com](http://meteosemplice.com). It's a nice web site where you can find all about forecast weather in more or less every city of the world.

As usually i started to develop this site to learn new technologies, this time was about GIS, postGIS and OpenWeatherMap API, but at the end it's become an useful site (i hope), so now it's become a nice site with a clear interface and i hope it will be useful. So if you want give an eye just point your browser url at [meteosemplice.com](http://meteosemplice.com) and start to forecast your weather!
