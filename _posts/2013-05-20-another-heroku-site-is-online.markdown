Well "another heroku site is online" or better "another octopress web site run now on heroku".

I just switched jaco.it to heroku and i've to say that it was a piece of cake.

Yes, i know that there is nothing really hard in order to move a little site as jaco.it and there is nothing really hard in order to move an octopress web site but it's my 1st step inside the heroku land and i'm sure that i'll be curious enough to learn really fast the heroku power.
