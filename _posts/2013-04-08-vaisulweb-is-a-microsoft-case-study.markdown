<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.vailsulweb.it">VaiSulWeb</a> is a fast-growing European hosting service provider that serves mostly small-business customers from a modern private-cloud infrastructure built on the Windows Server 2012 operating system and managed by Microsoft System Center 2012. VaiSulWeb looked to drive competitive advantage and grow markets by upgrading to System Center 2012 Service Pack 1 and implementing Windows Azure Services for Windows Server. With these technologies, VaiSulWeb was able to rapidly deploy a multitenant management portal with which it can offer self-service websites and virtual machines at low cost and high scale. The customer’s experience is similar to what they would enjoy with Windows Azure, the Microsoft public cloud service, but delivered from VaiSulWeb’s own data centers. VaiSulWeb also lowered data center costs by 50 percent by slashing hardware needs and centralizing data center management.
