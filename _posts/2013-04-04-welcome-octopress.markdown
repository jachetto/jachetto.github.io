Another blog is online, and the good news is another "Octopress Blog" is online.

So finally i moved from my experimental real time blog made with tornado to an "old" blogging style. 

If you don't know what "Octopress is" i'll quote from octopress web site:

{% blockquote octopress 2.0 surfaces http://octopress.org/blog/2011/07/23/octopress-20-surfaces/ %}
Octopress is a framework designed by <a href="http://octopress.org/blog/2011/07/23/octopress-20-surfaces/">Brandon Mathis</a> for <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekill</a>, the blog aware static site generator powering <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. To start blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care 
{% endblockquote %}

So welcome octopress and bye bye tornado, i'll write more next days
